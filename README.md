# The-happiness-data

Project carried out for the course "Foundations of Data Science: K-Means Clustering in Python" at the University of London. 
I decided to graph the average satisfaction of each country in comparison with the respective GDP, to see if a higher level of satisfaction corresponded to a higher level of GDP for each country;
First, sort the data by level of satisfaction from lowest to highest, and then filter the countries with an average satisfaction greater than 7;
The interesting thing about the labeled points is to see how countries like Costa Rica and Mexico have a high average satisfaction rate and a relatively low GDP; on the contrary, the United Kingdom and the United States have a lower level of satisfaction and a relatively high GDP.
It would seem that for very low-income levels, the level of GDP is a good estimator of the level of satisfaction. That is, the higher the GDP, the higher the satisfaction. But then, after a certain point, that correlation would not be as strong. Other variables besides money would come into play to determine the level of satisfaction and happiness.

It could be assumed as other variables the degree of sociability, family relationships, the health of the population, education, etc.

Does money make happiness?
